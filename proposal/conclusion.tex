Optimizations have been shown to be very effective at improving performance of compiled code.
While it is a common belief that modern compilers do not need to worry about optimizations, I don't believe that is correct.
I have shown that it is not enough to simply translate Curry to a language with an optimizing compiler.
Instead, Curry needs optimizations specifically designed for it.
In my dissertation I will be implementing three of these optimizations; shortcutting, backtracking, and unboxing.
I will also be showing the correctness of each of these optimizations.
