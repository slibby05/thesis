In order to demonstrate that I have completed the requirements for this presentation, I will deliver three products .
First, I will deliver an optimizing Curry compiler that implements the optimizations described in this paper.
While the compiler itself will be a physical product, I also intend to provide a logical framework
in which it is easy to write and test new optimizations.
Second, I will prove the correctness of each optimization.
Finally, I will demonstrate the efficiency of the compiler by comparing it to both an unoptimized compiler
and current Curry compilers.

While I believe the first two parts are self-explanatory, the final part will require more care.
Determining the efficiency of an optimization can be a tricky task, as Mytkowicz et al. showed \cite{wrongData}.
There is a possibility that we could use the STABILIZER platform \cite{STABILIZER} to alleviate these issues
Aside from the issues that Mytkowicz et al. raise, I also need to demonstrate that the optimizations are effective.
While I could just compare the performance to standard Curry compilers, I also plan to test each optimization in combination.
This will tell me which optimizations are effective, and which are redundant.
As an example, it may be that deforestation and shortcutting both optimize the same cases,
so, while it looks like they both provide a significant improvement, they may not perform as well in combination.
