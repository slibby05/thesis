\begin{itemize}
  \item an optimizing curry compiler, from source (or flat-curry) to executable code.
  \item justification for the correctness of optimizations
  \item evaluation against current curry compilers
  \begin{itemize}
    \item determine runtime/memory usage on ``real world'' programs
    \item test on multiple machines/environments
  \end{itemize}
