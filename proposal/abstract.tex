Functional logic programming allows us to write simple declarative programs for many complex tasks.
Unfortunately, many computer scientists consider current implementations of functional logic languages
to be too slow to use in practice.
This has lead to the idea that functional logic languages are inherently slow.
I think a more likely culprit is the fact that very little work on program optimization 
has been incorporated into modern functional logic compilers.
In this thesis I intend to develop an optimization framework for the functional logic language Curry.
This will include an intermediate language suitable for optimization,
as well as analysis of currently existing optimizations in functional and logic programming
to determine their suitability for Curry.
We also propose some new optimizations that are specific to Curry.
