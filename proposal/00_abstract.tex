It is a common belief in the Curry community that we can pass off the work of compiler optimizations
to more established compilers such as GHC and SICSTUS-Prolog.
While this seems reasonable, I will show that it has major consequences for the performance of Curry code.
Furthermore I show that these performance problems are a direct result of passing optimizations to other compilers.
I propose that in order to make Curry programs fast, we need to do the work of optimizing Curry programs ourselves.
To this end, I will develop an optimizing Curry compiler to demonstrate that Curry can be optimized, and that it is beneficial to do so.
